Fixed it!!! Wrong bootstrap CDN. react-bootstrap only takes 3.0 > 3.3.7 bootstrap cdn - i included 4.0.0 in my initial commit and submissions. This has been adjusted in the index.html.


### Installation

The prior iteration of the project included the wrong version of bootstrap. This has been fixed.

```sh
$ cd api-server
$ npm install
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ cd api-server
$ node server
$ cd frontend
$ npm start
```
